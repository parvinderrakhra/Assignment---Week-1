# Ethereum:  Second generation Blockchain

## Overview and Origin

Ethereum, often referred to as ‘world computer’ is a non-profit blockchain company, conceived in 2013, development work commenced in 2014, and was crowdfunded via Ether token sale, and the network went live on 30 July 2015.

Ethereum has an unusually long list of founders, it was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, & 5 others. Although Vitalik Buterin is more associated with the project, whereas some of the other key co-founders split and went on to build their own projects in blockchain space.
While Bitcoin pioneered blockchain technology as the first cryptocurrency, was pitched itself as an alternative to national currencies and aspires to be a medium of exchange and a store of value, Ethereum expanded on its predecessor’s vision of a decentralised payments system by building a global computer network, to facilitate immutable, programmatic contracts and applications via its own currency aka Ether.  The prime purpose of Ethereum is not to establish itself as an alternative monetary system but rather to facilitate and monetize the operation of the Ethereum smart contract and dApp platform.

## Ethereum's take on Smart Contract
Ethereum whitepaper describes the protocol as “Ethereum is a project which attempts to build the generalised technology; technology on which all transaction-based state machine concepts may be built. Moreover, it aims to provide to the end-developer a tightly integrated end-to-end system for building software on a hitherto unexplored compute paradigm in the mainstream: a trustful object messaging compute framework.”
Ethereum’s permissionless blockchain enables creation and development of applications, also called decentralised applications (dApps), without oversight from central authorities.  Ethereum utilises smart contract, a self-executing code, to carry out a set of instructions, which are then verified on the blockchain. The smart contracts are trustless, autonomous, decentralized, and transparent and are irreversible and unmodifiable once deployed.  
Smart contracts on Ethereum has been a game changer.  Most of the blockchain projects are trying to bring smart contract functionalities to their protocols.  Smart contracts are the key element of Ethereum. In them any algorithm can be encoded. Smart contracts are computer protocols that digitally facilitate the execution of an agreement, which are kept in public databases.	
Smart contract has multiple use cases and can be used in variety of fields.  Few examples are as follow:
•	Government voting system:
Smart contracts, as been trailed by sovereign countries at national and local level, to provide a secure environment making the voting system less susceptible to manipulation.
•	Financial services: 
Smart contracts help in transforming traditional financial services in multiple ways. In the case of insurance claims, they perform error checking, routing, and transfer payments to the user if everything is found appropriate.
•	Decentralised Finance:
Decentralised exchanges and wallets using smart contract to execute complex transactions removing the need of an intermediating party.
•	Gaming
Smart contracts allow developers to regulate their gaming economies by setting specific predefined conditions to control trading.

### Key benefits of Smart contracts:

#### Speed, efficiency and accuracy
Once a condition is met, the contract is executed immediately. Because smart contracts are digital and automated, there’s no paperwork to process and no time spent reconciling errors that often result from manually filling in documents.

#### Trust and transparency
Because there’s no third party involved, and because encrypted records of transactions are shared across participants, there’s no need to question whether information has been altered for personal benefit.

#### Security
Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, which makes them very hard to hack. Moreover, because each record is connected to the previous and subsequent records on a distributed ledger, hackers would have to alter the entire chain to change a single record.

#### Savings
Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries to handle transactions and, by extension, their associated time delays and fees.

## Competition
Ethereum has been a popular platform, and has attracted millions of daily users to its platform.  The increases in people using the platform has resulted in transactional bottlenecks, high gas fees (transaction fees to interacct with platform), inefficient energy consumption and slow processing.  While Ethereum is not going away and need time to get their house in order, new blockchain cryptos are growing in popularity and eating up Ethereum's market share. Some of these blockchians, are Layer 2 solutions built on Ethereum, copy of Ethereum with an updated protocol or a complete new take on how a private blockchain should work. Some of the notable projects are as follow

### Polkadot
Polkadot, described as "Next generation Blockchian" was cofounded by one of the Ethereum's cofounder - Gavin Woods,  was conceptualized as a part of the Web 3.0 hierarchy. Polkadot, connects multiple chains to greatly improve scalability and security. Polkadot crypto lets developers create their own blockchains, termed Parachains. These blockchains use Polkadot’s relay to speed and scale up transactions.

### Cardano
Cardano, founded by Ethereum's cofounder Charles Hoskinsen, is considered a third generation Blockahin, Cardano supports Proof of stake mechanism on its platform, which is considered a more environmentally sustainable alternative to Ethereum.  Cardano recently got updated to smart contract functionality via Alonzo hard fork in, *September of 2021*.
Time will tell whether Cardano can unseat Ethereum, or if similar learning curves will occur as more users transact on the Cardano blockchain.

### Solana
Solana, also touted as a fourth-generation blockchain that supports Proof-of-History - similar to Proof-of-Stake but with time stamping to speed up the process further.  Solana has a blazing fast block time of 400ms as compared to Ethereum’s 10-second and Bitcoin’s 10-minute limit. It comes with built-in support for smart contracts. 

**There are other notable competitoes like Avalanche, Fantom, Matic (a layer 2 solution on Ethereum), but they need more time to prove if they are worthy Ethereum competitors**

## Recommendation: 
For Ethereum to become a dominat player in Blockchian space, would have to get their house in order first.  One of the biggest challenge for Ethereum had been its scaling issue.  The gas fees are in hundreds, rather than in pennies (as was envisaged), transaction takes much longer than some of the competitors.
I believe, Ethereum would have to:
