# Blockchain:  Getting Smarter with Smart Contract

## Overview and Origin

Ethereum, often referred to as ‘world computer’ is a non-profit blockchain company, conceived in 2013, development work commenced in 2014, and was crowdfunded via Ether token sale, and the network went live on 30 July 2015.

Ethereum has an unusually long list of founders, it was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, & 5 others. Although Vitalik Buterin is more associated with the project, whereas some of the other key co-founders split and went on to build their own projects in blockchain space.
While Bitcoin pioneered blockchain technology as the first cryptocurrency, was pitched itself as an alternative to national currencies and aspires to be a medium of exchange and a store of value, Ethereum expanded on its predecessor’s vision of a decentralised payments system by building a global computer network, to facilitate immutable, programmatic contracts and applications via its own currency aka Ether.  The prime purpose of Ethereum is not to establish itself as an alternative monetary system but rather to facilitate and monetize the operation of the Ethereum smart contract and dApp platform.

## Ethereum's take on Smart Contract
Ethereum whitepaper describes the protocol as “Ethereum is a project which attempts to build the generalised technology; technology on which all transaction-based state machine concepts may be built. Moreover, it aims to provide to the end-developer a tightly integrated end-to-end system for building software on a hitherto unexplored compute paradigm in the mainstream: a trustful object messaging compute framework.”
Ethereum’s permissionless blockchain enables creation and development of applications, also called decentralised applications (dApps), without oversight from central authorities.  Ethereum utilises smart contract, a self-executing code, to carry out a set of instructions, which are then verified on the blockchain. The smart contracts are trustless, autonomous, decentralized, and transparent and are irreversible and unmodifiable once deployed.  
Smart contracts on Ethereum has been a game changer.  Most of the blockchain projects are trying to bring smart contract functionalities to their protocols.  Smart contracts are the key element of Ethereum. In them any algorithm can be encoded. Smart contracts are computer protocols that digitally facilitate the execution of an agreement, which are kept in public databases.	
Smart contract has multiple use cases and can be used in variety of fields.  Few examples are as follow:
•	Government voting system:
Smart contracts, as been trailed by sovereign countries at national and local level, to provide a secure environment making the voting system less susceptible to manipulation.
•	Financial services: 
Smart contracts help in transforming traditional financial services in multiple ways. In the case of insurance claims, they perform error checking, routing, and transfer payments to the user if everything is found appropriate.
•	Decentralised Finance:
Decentralised exchanges and wallets using smart contract to execute complex transactions removing the need of an intermediating party.
•	Gaming
Smart contracts allow developers to regulate their gaming economies by setting specific predefined conditions to control trading.

### Key benefits of Smart contracts:

#### Speed, efficiency and accuracy
Once a condition is met, the contract is executed immediately. Because smart contracts are digital and automated, there’s no paperwork to process and no time spent reconciling errors that often result from manually filling in documents.

#### Trust and transparency
Because there’s no third party involved, and because encrypted records of transactions are shared across participants, there’s no need to question whether information has been altered for personal benefit.

#### Security
Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, which makes them very hard to hack. Moreover, because each record is connected to the previous and subsequent records on a distributed ledger, hackers would have to alter the entire chain to change a single record.

#### Savings
Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries to handle transactions and, by extension, their associated time delays and fees.
